# 📋 What Changed - Complete Summary

## 🎉 All Your Requested Features Are Now Live!

I've enhanced the rostering system with **ALL 5 features** you requested. Here's what's new:

---

## ✅ 1. Leave History - View & Set

### What You Can Do:
- ✅ **View all leave history** for every employee
- ✅ **Add past leave records** manually
- ✅ **Delete incorrect entries**
- ✅ **Affects priority** - System uses this for calculating leave priorities

### Where to Find It:
**Management Tab** → Scroll to "Leave History Management"

### Why It Matters:
When employees apply for leave, the system checks their history. Fewer past leaves = higher priority for new leaves.

---

## ✅ 2. Employee Management - Add & Delete

### What You Can Do:
- ✅ **Add new employees** with name and ID
- ✅ **Delete employees** (removes all their data)
- ✅ **Auto-roster generation** for new employees
- ✅ **Safe deletion** with confirmation

### Where to Find It:
**Management Tab** → Top section "Employee Management"

### What Gets Deleted:
- Employee record
- All roster entries  
- Leave history
- Leave applications
- Overtime records

---

## ✅ 3. Shift Count Monitor - Know When 8+8 is Met

### What You Get:
- ✅ **Real-time monitoring** of day/night shift counts
- ✅ **Automatic warnings** when below 8+8 requirement
- ✅ **Daily breakdown** showing exact counts
- ✅ **Color-coded alerts** (Green = OK, Yellow = Shortage)

### Where to Find It:
**Management Tab** → Top section "Shift Count Monitor"

### What It Shows:
```
✅ All days have adequate staff (8 day + 8 night)
OR
⚠️ 5 days have staff shortages!
   Day 3: Shortage - Day: 6/8, Night: 7/8
   Day 7: Shortage - Day: 7/8, Night: 6/8
   ...
```

---

## ✅ 4. Pull Eligibility Checker - See Who Can/Cannot Be Pulled

### What You Get:
- ✅ **Select any date** to check
- ✅ **Can Pull List** - Shows available people with priority scores
- ✅ **Cannot Pull List** - Shows who's unavailable with exact reasons
- ✅ **Smart recommendations** - Highlights best candidates
- ✅ **Detailed information** - Previous shifts, recent pulls, comp offs

### Where to Find It:
**Pull Checker Tab** (New tab for admins)

### Information Shown:

**Can Be Pulled:**
- Priority score (lower number = better to pull)
- Current and previous shifts
- How many times recently pulled
- Compensatory offs owed
- Recommendation: "Good candidate" or "Recently pulled"

**Cannot Be Pulled:**
- Why they cannot be pulled:
  - "Had night shift previous day (rest required)"
  - "Already scheduled to work"

## ✅ 5. Month/Year Selector - Change Months & Set Rosters

### What You Can Do:
- ✅ **Switch between months/years** instantly
- ✅ **Auto-save current roster** when switching
- ✅ **Restore previous rosters** when switching back
- ✅ **Generate new rosters** for future months
- ✅ **Archive old rosters** automatically

### Where to Find It:

### How It Works:
1. Select month from dropdown
2. Enter year
3. System asks for confirmation
4. Current roster is saved
5. New roster is loaded or generated
